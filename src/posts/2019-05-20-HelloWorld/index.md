# Hello World

Just starting this programming website for the purpose of sharing what I am learning and working on.

First things I need to work on are:

- Customizing this website
- Purchasing domain
- Learning markdown
- Establishing Git workflow(even though this is a single person project it will be a good skill to have)

Future things to figure out:

- Putting sample React apps into this webpage to show what I am working on.

I am currently learning:

- [Road to learning React](https://roadtoreact.com/)
  - Axios instead of Fetch
- [P1xt Job ready Javascript guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-3.0.md)
  - [Learning to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
  - [Eloquent Javascript](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-3.0.md)
